# Calculator
My last big project for Foundations of the Odin Project! A fully functioning calculator.

I added a few extra features for fun, like a notepad on the left side, to keep track of your work, and a log of all buttons pressed on the right side, as a dynamic background. As it gets filled with nonesense, the right side of the page is like the messy code leaking out from behind the scenes! And the notepad on the left is like it all coming together into a working page.

Future updates will include optimization for smaller window sizes and mobile platforms. 

This project showed me how much I still have to learn to write clean code, how much time a tiny error or misunderstanding can take to fix, and how important it is to keep organizing my thoughts and my code from the start!
