# Calculator
My last big project for Foundations of the Odin Project! I added a few extra features for fun, like a notepad to keep track of your work, and a log of all buttons pressed as a dynamic background. As it gets filled with nonesense, the right side of the page is a bit like my brain as I tried to find my way through the logic on this calculator! And the notepad on the left is like all of the mess behind the scenes coming together into a working page :)

This project showed me how much I still have to learn to write clean code, how much time a tiny error or misunderstanding can take to fix, and how important it is to keep organizing my thoughts and my code from the start!
