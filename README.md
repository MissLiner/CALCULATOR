My last big project for Foundations of the Odin Project! I added a few extra features for fun, like a notepad to keep track of your work, and a log of all buttons pressed as a dynamic background. As it gets filled with nonesense, the right side of the page is like the messy code leaking out from behind the scenes! And the notepad on the left is like it all coming together into a working page :)

This project showed me how much I still have to learn to write clean code, how much time a tiny error or misunderstanding can take to fix, and how important it is to keep organizing my thoughts and my code from the start!
